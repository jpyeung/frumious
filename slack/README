These are the Python scripts used by Frumious Bandersnatch to sync organization
between Google Drive and Slack.

Scripts are as follows:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
quickstart.py - Reads a Google spreadsheet with a 'Sheet1' sheet
	and creates spreadsheets and Slack channels for puzzles,
	updating them accordingly based on status change

Usage: python3 quickstart.py -c [csvFile] -s [spreadsheetId]

Required:
	Files:
		slack-token.txt, a token (for Slack API)
		client_secret.json (for Google Drive/Sheets API)
		~/.credentials/sheets.googleapis.com-python-quickstart.json
			(this might be auto-generated if you can open a browser)

	Setup (run the following):
		python3 -m pip install --upgrade slackclient
		python3 -m pip install --upgrade google-api-python-client

	Arguments:
		-c, --csv: the file path to the csv that contains rows of the form
			meta name, folderId, prefix
		-s, --spreadsheet: the spreadsheet id of the master sheet to be parsed,
		    should contain a sheet called 'Sheet1'

Features:
	- Reads the 'Puzzle' column, creating a Slack channel if necessary
		(using a short, Slack-sanitized name)
	- Reads the 'Meta' column along with the meta csv to know where to put
		new puzzle spreadsheets
	- Reads the 'Spreadsheet Link' column, creating a Google spreadsheet in the
		specified folder if necessary (i.e., if the cell is empty)
	- Reads the 'Status' column, if not solved, unarchive channel and set title
		of the spreadsheet to the puzzle name; if solved, archive channel
		and set title of the spreadsheet to the form '[SOLVED] Puzzle - Answer'
	- Reads the 'Puzzle Link' column and sets that as the channel description
	- Reads the 'Spreadsheet Link' column and sets that as the channel topic
