These are the Python scripts used by Frumious Bandersnatch to sync organization
between Google Drive and Slack.

Scripts are as follows:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
quickstart.py - Reads a Google spreadsheet and creates spreadsheets and
	Slack channels for puzzles, updating them accordingly based on status change

Required:
	Files:
		slack-token.txt, a token (for Slack API)
		client_secret.json (for Google Drive/Sheets API)

	pip modules:
		slackclient
		google-api-python-client

	Arguments:
    	-f, --folder: the folder id where new spreadsheets should be created
        -s, --spreadsheet: the spreadsheet id of the master sheet to be parsed

Features:
- Reads the 'Puzzle' column, creating a Slack channel if necessary
	(using a short, Slack-sanitized name)
- Reads the 'Spreadsheet Link' column, creating a Google spreadsheet in the
	specified folder if necessary (i.e., if the cell is empty)
- Reads the 'Status' column, if not solved, unarchive channel and set title
	of the spreadsheet to the puzzle name; if solved, archive channel and set
	title of the spreadsheet to the form '[SOLVED] Puzzle - Answer'
- Reads the 'Puzzle Link' column and sets that as the channel description
- Reads the 'Spreadsheet Link' column and sets that as the channel topic
